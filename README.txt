Chess-Invaders

Game for PySummerHack 2016 by Knowledge.

Developed with Python 3.3 and Pygame 1.9, but should work on other versions as well.

Intended to be hacked.

In game you control ship-figures which contains smaller figures and when one ship attacked other small figures fight.

But because I didn't implement smaller figures, you are free to do anything you want with game.

Game doesn't implement Glitch Mode, but you as a hacker can implement it.

Good luck!
